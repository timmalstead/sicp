;In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with define

(define size 6)

(+ 4 size)
;prints out 10

;thus define is the scheme's language simplest method of abstraction

;define is known as a special form. they are shorthands hard coded into the programming language to allow us to be able to actually, you know, do stuff

; + and * are also special forms
; list syntax is pretty dang simple, compared to a lot of other languages
